Attempt to systematically discover all possible equations for a Elementary School Math Challenge

# The Challenge

Using the numbers 1, 8, 9, and 6 once and only once, and in that order,
find an equation that totals 0, 1, 2, etc., to 100. You may use the following operations:

   . +, -, *, and /
   . Exponent
   . Factorial
   . Join (e.g. "1" and "8" become "18"). But this may only be done on the original numbers.
   . Absolute Value
   - Square Root
   
Here is a sample of the output:
